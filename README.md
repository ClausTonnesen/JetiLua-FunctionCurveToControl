# JetiLua-FunctionCurveToControl
Add a Function curve to a control (1 - 3 controls). This script enables a function curve on a control input.
For use with e.g. Butterfly setup, Gyro adjustment and other settings where a Control input is required but no function curve available.
Spin off from the Butterfly script. Initial release - awaiting test on DS/DC16 and in real world in general ;-)
You only need to download the FnC2Ctl.lc file.
Further documentation to follow.
Use at own risk.
